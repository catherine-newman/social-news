# News Site

An interactive news site that allows users to vote and comment on articles. The site allows filtering by topic and multiple sorting options.  
This site was made using React as the front-end portion of a full stack project, connecting to a back-end API that I created previously.
Voting, commenting, filtering sorting, posting and deleting are all handled by this API.

A hosted version of this project can be found [here](https://main--subtle-wisp-17479d.netlify.app/).  
(Please allow 30 seconds for it to spin up before viewing)

This site makes use of a back-end API that I created [here](https://news-api-qn5t.onrender.com/api)
